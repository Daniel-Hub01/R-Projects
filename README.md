# R-Projects

## This Github repository features two projects written in R programming:

## (A) Alzheimer's Disease Classification Challenge:
Using MRIs and gene expression data, this project aimed to classify patients into three stages of Alzheimer's disease: CTL (Controls), MCI (Mild Cognitive Impairment), and AD (Alzheimerâ€™s Disease). The datasets used included ADCTLtrain (430 features + 1 label), ADMCItrain (64 features + 1 label), and MCICTLtrain (594 features + 1 label), encompassing demographic, clinical, CSF, medical imaging, and transcriptomics data. The classification problems addressed were AD vs CTL, AD vs MCI, and MCI vs CTL.

## (B) Comparative Analysis of Parametric & Non-parametric Models:
This study compared the performance of linear regression (lm) and k-nearest neighbors (KNN) models in predicting a target variable based on independent variables. The project involved exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and model training using 10-fold cross-validation. Evaluation was based on root mean squared error (RMSE) values, with the lm and KNN models achieving RMSE of 0.00 and 1.73 respectively on the test dataset. The findings provide insights into the strengths and limitations of each approach for regression modeling.
